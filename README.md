The ToDo lists of ToDo lists

For a beginner to looking to familiarise themselves with any framework, they will create their own ToDo list. 
Unfortunately, most ToDo list tutorials are incomplete. They only show the easy parts, like how to add or delete ToDo lists, but miss out on more complex use cases.
At the same time, the React ecosystem is quite rich but can be quite overwhelming. For example, should someone integrate Redux in their app, and why should they do so?

This is a repository of ToDo lists. It will start out from the most basic ToDo list in React, before migrating to React hooks and other features in React. Then it will move on to common frameworks like Redux, or Typescript. I will attempt to explain the rationale for introducing a new framework without overwhelming users.

# ToDo list roadmap
1. React classes - the most basic ToDo list with the most simple syntax.
2. React hooks
3. React contexts
4. React + Redux
